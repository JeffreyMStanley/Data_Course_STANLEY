#Identifiing snakes using mitocondrial DNA


## Introduction
### it can be hard to find out what type of snakes can be found in a given area..... there is a non-invase way to test which snakes are found in a location by extracting mtDNA from sheded snake skin and then barcoding the DNA with the COI gene. this obviously needs to be eddited. 

##methods
### full mitochondial and the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequncenses were gathered from NCBI for mostly snakes and a few lizards that can be used as outgroups. I aligned the the full mitochondial genome using the msa packedge with the ClustalW and the default settings to build a tree. I alinged the COI and the full mitochonirial sequnce using a local pairwise alignment from the GenomicAlignments package. from these allignments I was able to separate the COI sequence as well as get the ranges in an Irang format. from the separted COI sequence another tree was built. 



### a snipit of the full alignment. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
alignment = readRDS("./alignment.RDS")
print(alignment) 


```

# maybe something about having to allign each one seperatly thing seperatly or an example
```{r echo=TRUE}
agk = readDNAStringSet("./Project_Data/Agkistrodon_p_mt.fasta")
agkCOI = readDNAStringSet("./Project_Data/COI/COI_Agkistrodon_p.fasta")

agkaln = Biostrings::pairwiseAlignment(agkCOI, agk, type = "local")


```
