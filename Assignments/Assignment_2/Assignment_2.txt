1. 
cd Desktop/Data_Course/Data/data-shell/data/pdb 
wc -l m*

2. 
wc -l m* > m_lines.txt
cd ../../../../../
cd Data_Course_STANLEY
mkdir ./Assignments
cd Assignments
mkdir ./Assignment_2
I went back to Desktop/Data_Course/Data/data-shell/data/pdb

mv m_lines.txt -t ~/Desktop/Data_Course_STANLEY/Assignments/Assignment_2/

3. 
cut -d "," animals.txt -f2 | sort -u > unique_animals.txt | mv unique_animals.txt ~/Desktop/Data_Course_STANLEY/Assignments/Assignment_2/

4. 
cut -d "," BioLog_Plate_Data.csv -f5 | sort -u > unique_C-substrates.txt | mv unique_C-substrates.txt ~/Desktop/Data_Course_STANLEY/Assignments/Assignment_2/

5.
wc -l *.txt | sort -nr
this just sorts them from most amound of lines to the fewest but I found out that sunspot.txt has the most amount of lines at 3080
